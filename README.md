# Key Projects
1. Accenture Machine Learning Challenge Project (Break Through Tech AI Program)
  Check out my team's project repository for the real-world ML project we worked on for Accenture for over 3 months, as part of the Break Through Tech AI Program's Fall 2024 AI Studio! [Accenture Team Project Git}(https://github.com/oyu-e/btt-accenture1c)
3. AR Water Crisis Project
   I wanted to bring attention to the water crisis in an interactive way. I created an augmented world that users could place anywhere and interact with. I used Blender to craft 3D objects and water simulations that when tapped by users would play the animations I designed and coded.
